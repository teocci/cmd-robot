= Introduction =

Throughout the construction of the robot we have developed and will continue developing a series of prototypes.

=Prototype 1=

==General Info==

Our first prototype was created on the 11th November which incorporated:

  * Ad-hoc network data exchange with network hosted on RPi (only after Monday the 12th November)
  * Control Module Beta version 1.5.6
  * 2 Motors powered by L293D H-Bridge IC

==Features==

Prototype 1 featured:

  * Individual PWM control of 2 motors
  * Wireless network control
  * Joystick, WASD and debugging mode (alpha stage)

== Footage ==

Below is footage of prototype 1:

=Prototype 2=

==General Info==
Prototype 2 of CMDoverwatch incorporated mainly hardware changes. For the first time our robot was able to move around. This meant that the software we had written could be put to test in a real world situation.

==Features==

Prototype 2 had the following features:

  * 2 *NEW* high speed motors
  * Ability to move around
  * Proper wheels and motor mounts onto a make-shift wooden frame
  * Wireless communication (cables required for power influx)

=Alpha Build=

==General Info==

CMDoverwatch Alpha was the first fully mobile unit which brought with it a series of other challenges. 

==Features==
  * 4 High powered, medium torque motors
  * Proper wooden ply chassis
  * Properly secured motor mounts
  * 
==Challenges==
===Power===
The first challenge was providing a sustainable solution to on board power. Early stages of the build used a series of AA batteries linked in series but due to their quick exhaustion by the 4 motors were replaced by 2 super heavy duty, rechargeable, 6V lantern batteries.
