= Introduction =

This page is used to show the set-up of the motors when the motors failed.  Hopefully this will help debug and solve what would have caused the problem / fault.


= Details =

A few points before we continue:
 * There is four motors in this set-up
 * The motors are 19:1 Metal Gear-motors with 5 kg cm torque 
 * We are using the Pololu Motor Shield (Dual-VNH5019-Motor-Shield)
 * Two motors are running out of each H-bridge
 * Running off 12 volts (2 x 6 volt lantern batteries)
 * PWM is used so that the motors are not always running off 12 volts and to vary the speed.
 * The Gertboard (and Raspberry Pi) are used as a substitute for the Arduino


== Some Diagrams ==

Below is the wiring diagram used to wire the Shield:
