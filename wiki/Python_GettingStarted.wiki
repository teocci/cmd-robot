= Introduction =

In-order for you to complete this project, you must learn the python programming language.  


= Word Bank =

||Algorithm|| a process or set of rules to be followed in calculations or other problem-solving operations, especially by a computer.||
||Binary|| relating to, composed of, or involving two things.  In Computing, also refers to the signalling system used by computers in '1' and '0'.||
||CLI || Command-Line Interface.  eg. Command Prompt, Terminal. ||
||Control Structure || A group of statements which determines the order the statements are to be executed. ||
||Data || raw figures and signals, which may not convey a mean to a person. ||
||Data Type || a particular kind of data item, as defined by the values it can take, the programming language used, or the operations that can be performed on it. ||
||Error || a problem in the code that may cause the program not to work properly. ||
||Function || a sequence of program instructions that perform a specific task, packaged as a one. ||
||GUI || Graphical User Interface.  eg. Windows 7, MacOSX. ||
||Integer || a data type, which uses only whole numbers. ||
||Interpreter || an interpreter is a computer program that directly executes instructions written in a programming language, without previously compiling them into machine language (ones and zeros). ||
||Logic || the way the program is written, in a particular order to achieve a task following the syntax of the programming language. ||
||Module || a separate part of a program that has that contains everything necessary to execute only one aspect of the desired functionality. ||
||Program || a sequence of instructions, written to perform a specified task with a computer. ||
||Software || any set of machine-readable instructions that directs a computer's processor to perform specific operations. ||
||Source Code || a text listing of commands to be compiled or assembled into an executable computer program. ||
||String || a data type, that contains any number of characters (letters, numbers, etc). ||
||Syntax ||  The grammar of the programming language.  This must be followed, otherwise your program won't work. ||
||Variable || a named space in the RAM that can be used to store numbers and strings. ||


= Control Structures (Basic Concepts) =

There are 5 control structures that can be used when programming.  They are:
 * Sequence
 * Binary Selection
 * Multiway Selection
 * Pre-test loop
 * Post-test loop

For this project, you will be using four of the five listed above (you won't be using post-test loops)

== Sequence ==

This involves the code running in order of the command listed.  Or put another way, every line run once in order.

==== Example ====
<pre>
BEGIN
command one
command two
...
command one hundred
END
</pre>
