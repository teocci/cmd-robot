#summary An introduction into H-bridges

= Introduction =

H-bridges allow for large current consuming devices, like motors, to be switched on an off (or have their speed varied). In our project we have 2 main H-bridge setups. The first setup is with the Polulu VNH5019 and the second is the L293 IC.


= Polulu VNH5019 =

The Pololu Dual VNH5019 Motor Driver Shield is built specifically for use with an Arduino. It is currently the H-bridge used for CMDoverwatch to operate the 4 motors.

==Features==
The shield features:
  * Operating voltage range: 5.5 â€“ 24 V1
  * High output current: up to 12 A continuous (30 maximum) per motor
  * Inputs compatible with both 5V and 3.3V systems
  * PWM operation up to 20 kHz, which is ultrasonic and allows for quieter motor operation
  * Motor indicator LEDs show what the outputs are doing even when no motor is connected
  * When used as a shield, the motor power supply can optionally be used to power the Arduino base as well
  * Can survive input voltages up to 41 V
